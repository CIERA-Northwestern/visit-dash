# What to group by
# If you add additional categorical columns to the data, you can specify them here and they will be added to the dashboard.
groupings:
  - Host Types
  - Programs

## Column Classifications
# The anything that's in a given grouping can be analyzed similarly.
primary_id_column: index
id_columns: # Unique identifiers
  - id
  - Name
numerical_columns: # Numeric columns that can be summed
  - Visiting Days
date_columns: # Dates
  - Date
x_columns: # Data will be binned by these along the x-axis
  - Year (Flexible) # For example, a value of 2019 would be grouped into the 2019-2020 financial year
categorical_columns: # Categorical columns that can be grouped, e.g. all Press Types=="Science" articles
  - Host Types
  - Origin (International/Domestic)
  - Programs
  - Visitor Institution
  - Host
  
text_columns: # Text columns that can be searched
  - id

## Custom Categories
# Use boolean logic to define categories.
# In addition to boolean logic, preceeding the definition with 'only' will restrict the category to only the tags that show up in the proceeding definition.
# Any categories not defined here will be left as is if they are the sole tag, or added to an 'Other' category if they are one of multiple tags.
