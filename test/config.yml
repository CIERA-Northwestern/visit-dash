# What to group by
# If you add additional categorical columns to the data, you can specify them here and they will be added to the dashboard.
groupings:
  - Research Topics
  - Press Types
  - Categories

## Column Classifications
# The anything that's in a given grouping can be analyzed similarly.
primary_id_column: index
id_columns: # Unique identifiers
  - id
  - Title
numerical_columns: # Numeric columns that can be summed
  - Press Mentions
  - People Reached
date_columns: # Dates
  - Date
x_columns: # Data will be binned by these along the x-axis
  - Year # For example, a value of 2019 would be grouped into the 2019-2020 financial year
categorical_columns: # Categorical columns that can be grouped, e.g. all Press Types=="Science" articles
  - Research Topics
  - Press Types
  - Categories
text_columns: # Text columns that can be searched

## Custom Categories
# Use boolean logic to define categories.
# In addition to boolean logic, preceeding the definition with 'only' will restrict the category to only the tags that show up in the proceeding definition.
# Any categories not defined here will be left as is if they are the sole tag, or added to an 'Other' category if they are one of multiple tags.
new_categories:
  # Press types are defined hierarchicaly.
  Press Types:
    'External Press (Inclusive)': "'External Press'" # Anything tagged as External Press will be included in this category
    'Northwestern Press (Inclusive)': "'Northwestern Press' & (not 'External Press')" # Anything tagged with Northwestern Press but not External Press will be included in this category
    # CIERA press is left undefined, so it defaults to showing up as usual, provided it is not also tagged with Northwestern Press or External Press.
  # Research topics are defined as falling into one of three main categories: Exploding & Dead Stars, Astrophysical Populations, and Exoplanets & the Solar System.
  Research Topics:
    'Compact Objects': "only ('Life & Death of Stars' | 'Gravitational Waves & Multi-Messenger Astronomy' | 'Black Holes & Dead Stars')"
    'Cosmological Populations': "only ('Galaxies & Cosmology' | 'Stellar Dynamics & Stellar Populations')"
  # Article categories are grouped into research, outreach, and achievements & events, with research and outreach categorization superseeding achievements & events.
  Categories:
    'Research': "('Science' | 'Data Science & Computing') & (not ('Education' | 'Outreach'))"
    'Outreach': "('Education' | 'Outreach') & (not ('Science' | 'Data Science & Computing'))"
    'Achievements & Events': "only ('Achievement' | 'Event' | 'Interdisciplinary')"
  # You can use the same source category for multiple new categories by placing the source column in brackets.
  "Multi-messenger Astro vs everything else [Research Topics]":
    'GW': "'Gravitational Waves & Multi-Messenger Astronomy'" # Anything tagged as GW will be included in this category
